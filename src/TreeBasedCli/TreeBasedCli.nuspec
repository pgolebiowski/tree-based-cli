    <description>
        TreeBasedCli is a C# library that simplifies the process of creating command-line interfaces (CLIs) with nested subcommands. This library is designed to help developers build CLIs that offer an intuitive and user-friendly experience, with clear and concise documentation and actionable error messages to guide users through the command tree. With TreeBasedCli, you can easily organize and structure your CLI's functionality, and take advantage of native support for asynchronous command execution and customizable dependency injection.

        Whether you're building a small personal CLI or a larger, more complex application, TreeBasedCli is a powerful choice that helps you create CLIs that provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for your users.
